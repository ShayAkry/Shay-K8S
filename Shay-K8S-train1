ASSIGNMENT STEPS 👇 
FIRST : Take the voting app presentation (PPT) and understand the landscape of the application.


1. go to root (cd $home )
>> Done
2. git clone https://github.com/ashishrpandey/example-voting-app

>>> done
3. cd /root/example-voting-app/k8s-specifications
>>> done
4. kubectl apply -f .
>>> done
5. for voting and result pods, Observe that NodePort is assigned.
>>> done
6. take your publicIP (your instance IP) : NodePort ► open 2 browsers , one for VOTING and one for Results.
>>> done
7 try voting and see the results paralelly in results page.
>>> done, see all OK

8. Now try to delete the Pods one by one (first voting Pod, then worker pod, then db pod) and see what happens to the voting and result app after deleting.

☝️ Delete them in same order 
1st ► VOTE pod ► Observe what happens both in frontEnd & in Unix
2nd ► WORKER pod ► Observe what happens both in frontEnd & in Unix
3rd ► DB pod ► Observe what happens both in frontEnd & in Unix
☝️ Dont delete REDIS or Result Pods 
>>> once we delete the voting Pod – it was terminated and new voting Pod was created – both wed page continue to work OK.
>>> once we delete the worker Pod – it was terminated and new worker Pod was created – both wed page continue to work OK.
>>> once we delete the db Pod – it was terminated and new db Pod was created – the vote wed page continue to work OK, but the result wed page was stuck, after refresh the page we got default values and info was not update.
>>> only after I delete the result pod and refresh the result web page – all continue to work OK.
9 Write your observations in a text file.
>>> See below 
10. what happens after db pod deletion?
>>> See below
11. complete the assignment by making the result pod work.
>>> only after I delete the result pod and refresh the result web page – all continue to work OK.
12. Write in the text file, what you did in order to make the result pod work.
>>> only after I delete the result pod and refresh the result web page – all continue to work OK.
in summary, your text file should contain:

1. Commands that you used during the assignment. (not Mandatory, if you have time, please write it)

2. snapshot of logs (wherever possible, not mandatory, if you have time, please write it)

3. your comment on WHY result app STOPPED working after db pod stop
>>> I assume the order we initiate / start the pods is important.
>>> Since the result pod is the one which establish the connection with the DB.
>>> So when delete the db pod, new db pod was created – but it was isolate from the result pod.
>>> After delete the result pod, new result pod was created + need to refresh the web page and all works OK.

>>> Question:
>>> How came the connection of the DB with the worker did not break ?
>>> Why do I need to refresh the result web page ?
4. your answer to HOW YOU MADE THE RESULT POD work.
>>> only after I delete the result pod and refresh the result web page – all continue to work OK.
5. Some jargons (just names are enough- dont need sentences) that you learnt from the Training session
>>> pod do have relation between them, so the order we initiate / start them is important
